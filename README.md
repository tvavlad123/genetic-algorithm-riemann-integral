# genetic-algorithm-riemann-integral


Genetic algorithms can be used successfully in problems which involve calculation of Riemann integrals
especially when an integrand has a primitive which can't be expressed analytically through elementary functions.
This algorithm uses the classic genetic algorithm: fitness proportionate selection, one-point crossover & mutation.
